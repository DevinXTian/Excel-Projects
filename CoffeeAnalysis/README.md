# üìä Project Overview
In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of an Excel dataset, which included orders, customer information,
and product details for a coffee business. Leveraging advanced Excel functionalities, I utilized formulas like 
Index-Match and XLOOKUP to merge and align data across different worksheets.

# üõ†Ô∏è Data Manipulation and Analysis
To transform this information into actionable insights, I created pivot tables that allowed me to create dynamic visualizations, effectively highlighting key trends in the data. These visualizations included bar charts and time series graphs, which were enhanced by slicers and a timeline. The slicers allowed for interactive
filtering, enabling users to view specific subsets of the data based on variables like coffee type or customer information.
Additionally, the timeline provided a dynamic tool for exploring changes over specific periods, making it easier to track
growth and identify cyclical trends. 

# üí° Insights and Recommendations
Drawing on these data-driven visualizations, I developed recommendations to increase revenue and engage customers more effectively. Notably, among the top five highest-paying customers, only one had a loyalty card. This highlights a big opportunity to grow our loyalty program and boost spending among valuable customers. Also, sales consistently rise after each July. This trend suggests we should explore further to understand the reasons and plan targeted promotions. Simple pricing strategies like special discounts for loyalty card holders or themed events during this peak time could increase profits.
